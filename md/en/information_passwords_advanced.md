Recording passwords securely
============================

Our Basic section showed you how to create a strong, memorable password.
However, because you need a different password for every account or
service and also need to change them every few months, it can soon
become difficult to remember them all. Fortunately, there are software
tools to help with this ? a password manager is a software application
that can generate random, secure passwords for each of your accounts and
record them in a portable, encrypted password database, such as KeePass.

The password manager protects all of your passwords with a single master
password so you only have to remember one thing. Of course, if you use
this method, it becomes especially important that you create and
remember a very secure password for KeePass, or whatever tool you
choose. Whenever you need to enter a password for a specific account,
you can look it up using only your master password, which makes it much
easier to follow all of the suggestions above.

KeePass sits on your desktop, and it also portable, which means that you
can put the database on a USB memory stick in case you need to look up a
password while you are away from your primary computer.

You can learn how to set up and use this tool in the [Keepass tool
guide](umbrella://lesson/keepassx).

Tips for using password managers
================================

There are few things to keep in mind when using password databases.

-   If you lose or accidentally delete your only copy of a password
    database, you will no longer have access to any of the accounts for
    which it contained passwords. This makes it extremely important that
    you back up your KeePass database. Read our [Backing Up
    lesson](umbrella://lesson/backing-up) for instructions on how to
    do this.
-   If you forget your KeePass master password, there is no way to
    recover it or the contents of the database. So, be sure to choose a
    master password that is both secure and memorable!

-   It is also crucially important to keep your password manager
    itself secure.
    ? Some password managers will offer to store your passwords ?in the
    cloud,? which is to say, they will store your passwords encrypted on
    a remote server, and when you need them on a laptop or mobile, they
    will retrieve and decrypt them for you automatically. Password
    managers like this are more convenient, but the trade-off is that
    they are more vulnerable to attack. If you just keep your passwords
    on your computer, then someone who can take over your computer may
    be able to get hold of them. If you keep them in the cloud, your
    attacker may target that also. It's not usually a compromise you
    need to worry about unless your attacker has legal powers over the
    password manager company or is known for targeting companies or
    internet traffic.
-   When you use a password manager, the security of your passwords and
    your master password is only as strong as the security of the
    computer where the password manager is installed and used. If your
    computer or device is compromised and spyware is installed, the
    spyware can watch you type your master password and could steal the
    contents of the password safe. So it's still very important to keep
    your computer and other devices clean of malicious software when
    using a password manager. You can learn more about this in the
    [Malware lesson](umbrella://lesson/malware).

Two-step authentication
=======================

Many services and software tools let you use two-step authentication.
Here the idea is that in order to log in, you need to be in possession
of a certain physical object: usually a mobile phone, but, in some
versions, a special device called a security token. Using two-step
authentication ensures that even if your password for the service is
hacked or stolen, the thief won't be able to log in unless they also
have control of a second device, such as your phone, and the special
codes that only it can create.

Two-step authentication using a mobile phone can be done in two ways:
the service can send you an SMS text message to your phone whenever you
try to log in which provides an extra security code that you need to
type in. Alternatively, your phone can run an authenticator application,
such as [Google
Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2),
that generates security codes from inside the phone itself. This will
help protect your account in situations where an attacker has your
password but does not have physical access to your mobile phone.

One-time passwords
==================

Some services, such as Google, also allow you to generate a list of
one-time passwords, also called single-use passwords. These are meant to
be printed or written down on paper and carried with you.

There is no way to do this by yourself if you're using a service that
doesn't offer it.

If you or your organization runs your own communications infrastructure,
such as your own e-mail servers, there's freely available software that
can be used to enable two-step authentication for accessing your
systems. Ask your systems administrators to look for software offering
an implementations of the open standard ?Time-Based One-Time Passwords?
or RFC 6238.
