Countering Physical Surveillance
================================

Physical surveillance continues to be a significant danger to those
working on human rights. Other than a human source, it is the only way
to build detail on what is occurring at meetings. It is obviously
important to know how to identify if you, your colleagues, or partners
are under surveillance.

Counter-surveillance is the process of detecting and mitigating hostile
surveillance. This lesson lets you know how to practice
counter-surveillance at one of the most important times ? when you are
in a vehicle, such as going to a sensitive meeting.

===========================================================================================

There are a number of indicators that might let you know if a vehicle is
being used to conduct mobile surveillance.

Look out for:

-   Common vehicles for the area ? a team will try to use the most
    inconspicuous vehicle for the local environment
-   Unusual aerials
-   Modified boxes on top
-   Equipment in the car ? Maps, radios, GPS, binoculars, cameras etc.
-   Rubbish in a car
-   Parking for quick exit
-   Windows left slightly open
-   ?Boot fit?
-   One or at most two people in a vehicle
-   Radio operator talking into a radio
-   Two people in a stopped car talking but not apparently to each other
-   Leaving an engine on unnecessarily
-   Brake lights being activated when a vehicle is stationary
-   Don?t forget taxis, rickshaws or expensive looking cars.

**Identifying Teams**\
\
If you identify one potential surveillance member, you can use that
knowledge to identify others. Members of a surveillance team can
cross-contaminate other members:

-   By looking in their direction
-   By using hand signals
-   By parking their car or stopping in the same place (e.g. they have
    relieved each other)
-   By poor discipline/drills/boredom and pulling their cars up
    alongside each other in order to have an unnecessary conversation.

What can you do to spot them?
=============================

The most important thing to remember when conducting
counter-surveillance is that you need to be discreet ? you do not want
any potential surveillance teams to know that you are looking for them.
This would raise suspicions further about what you intended to do. **The
primary aim is to ascertain whether or not you are being followed, not
to lose them.**

Remember, if you discover you are in fact under surveillance, you have
three options:

-   **hange your plans:**This is the safest and recommended option ? it
    will allow you to keep your original plans to yourself and reassure
    whoever had you under surveillance that you aren?t up to anything
    suspicious or worthy of surveillance.
-   **Lose the surveillance covertly:**This is losing the surveillance
    team without them knowing you were aware of them by making it
    look accidental. This should be used if you absolutely must keep
    your plans and you feel it is safe to do so.
-   **Lose the surveillance overtly:**This trying to identify or lose
    the surveillance team in a way that makes them aware of what you are
    trying to do. This is a risky tactic because it confirms to the team
    that you are indenting to do something that you don?t want them to
    see and so are increases the likelihood of you being under
    continued surveillance. You should only conduct your
    counter-surveillance overtly if absolutely vital and it is not
    possible to do so covertly.

Five Rules of Counter-Surveillance
==================================

### 1. Trigger

This is the person who initially alerts the rest of the surveillance
team when the target is on the move. The easiest person to find.

### 2. 10 to 2

The person carrying out the surveillance will try to stay out of a the
10 t0 2: the immediate eye line of the person they have put under
surveillance

### 3. 3 times

This is the number of sightings of a surveillance team member you are
aiming to achieve before you can confirm that you are under
surveillance.

### 4. 3 sides of a square

This is the minimum number of turns you take to filter and reduce the
possibility of seeing the same person by coincidence.

### 5. Breaking the box

This is the process of breaking out of the surveillance a team will try
to keep you in. By breaking the box you increase the likelihood that
they will make mistakes which you can observe and use to identify them.

Tactics: How to find the eyeball
================================

When looking for repeat sightings in a vehicle, use the following
tactics if safe to do so:

-   Look for repeat sightings
-   Use a false indicator
-   Drive fast / slow
-   Stop suddenly (try to have a reason for this ? such as pulling in at
    a petrol station at the very last minute or taking a mobile
    phone call)
-   U-turn
-   Move into a filter lane turning right and at the last minute
    continue straight
-   Stop immediately after taking a left turn ? will force others to
    overtake
-   Change lanes
-   Turn into a dead end
-   Enter onto a fast road such as a dual carriageway/motorway and then
    come off it quickly
-   Exit a dual carriageway/motorway and then come straight back onto it
    again
-   Use your mirrors
-   Create opportunities to look around
-   Stretch out the team
-   Create opportunities (if absolutely vital) to evade a surveillance
    team

If the political environment allows, pull in to a police station or ring
colleagues/ backup to meet you at a designated spot where you can aim to
safely lead any potential surveillance team members which you haven?t
broken contact with.

Tactics: Chokepoints
====================

Chokepoints are areas that anyone following you must pass through, and
so allow for better observation and filtering of potential surveillance.
Some naturally occurring chokepoints could be:

-   Small relatively deserted laneway/alleyway with few paralleling
    lanes/roads
-   Traffic lights
-   Roundabouts
-   Road junctions
-   One way streets
-   Car park entrances/exits
-   Toll booths
-   Quiet roads
-   Long straight roads
-   Road works

If using a roundabout as a chokepoint, try to record up to 10 of the
vehicles following the vehicle which is potentially under surveillance ?
Try to note the registration and description (colour, make, model,
unique descriptive features, number of occupants, presence of radios
etc.) This is because a handover to another car may take place here ? so
another person would now have the target in their line of sight.

Look for a handover: When turning, look for vehicles (or people on foot)
who might match the profile of surveillance team members but then
continue straight.

Spotting Trackers
=================

A tracker is a device placed on a car to monitor its location. This is
often used by surveillance teams instead of physically following a
person?s car.

Some trackers (particularly those used by government agencies) allow the
surveillance team to track a target in real time and to monitor
historical paths. Some trackers only log the journey taken by the target
vehicle. They do not allow the surveillance team to track the vehicle
live ? instead the tracker must be retrieved by the team and analysed on
a laptop.

You should be particularly aware of the risk of trackers if you think
your work is of interest to the authorities and your car is kept in a
publicly accessible areas at any time. You should regularly check your
car for trackers and particularly before going to any sensitive
meetings.

Trackers are usually placed on the base of a car using magnets. They can
also be placed in the boot or roof. You need to get right under the car
and feel around corners with your hands to do a proper check.

Trackers can be the size of a phone or even smaller. They can also be
covered in tape or oil to help disguise it as part of the car.
