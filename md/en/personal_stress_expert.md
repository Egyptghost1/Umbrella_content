Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - Causes
=======================================

What happens if people don?t heal within the weeks following the trauma?

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops in about 1 in 3 people
who experience severe trauma. Certain factors such as if you or your
family have had depression or anxiety in the past, or you don't receive
much support from family or friends, can make you more susceptible to
developing PTSD after a traumatic event.

In most cases, PTSD develops during the first month after a traumatic
event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months
or even years before symptoms start to appear.

Effects
=======

The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but
they generally fall into the categories described below. These symptoms
are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on
the person?s day-to-day life.

**Re-experiencing**\
Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a
person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the
form of flashbacks, nightmares or repetitive and distressing images or
sensations. This can even include physical sensations such as pain,
sweating and trembling or negative thoughts about their experience.

**Avoidance**\
Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key
symptom of PTSD. This usually means avoiding certain people or places
that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your
experience. Many people with PTSD try distracting themselves with work
or hobbies. Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying
not to feel anything at all, which can lead to the person becoming
isolated and withdrawn.

**Feeling 'on edge**\
Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax.
They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled. This state
of mind is known as hyper-arousal. Hyper-arousal often leads to
irritability, angry outbursts, sleeping problems (insomnia) and
difficulty concentrating.

**Other problems**\
Many people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including:

-   depression, anxiety and phobias
-   drug misuse or alcohol misuse
-   headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches
-   PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown
    of relationships.

Dealing with it
===============

It is normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a
traumatic event, but in most people these will improve naturally over a
few weeks. However you should visit your doctor if you are still having
problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the
symptoms are particularly troublesome. Your doctor may refer you to
mental health specialists if they feel you would benefit from treatment.

PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after
a traumatic event. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how
soon they occur after the traumatic event. Any of the following
treatment options may be recommended:

-   Watchful waiting - waiting to see whether the symptoms improve
    without treatment
-   Psychological treatment - such as psychotherapy or trauma-focused
    cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
-   Antidepressant medication
