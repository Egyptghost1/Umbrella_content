Dealing with the kidnapping of a member of staff is a very sensitive and
complex task. This lesson provides only the basic outline for
recommended actions.

**If one of your staff is kidnapped we highly recommend reading the
detailed advice given in the ?Further Reading? links at the end of this
lesson.**

If kidnap occurs, the organisation should immediately set up a crisis
management team, in HQ if possible. It should be made clear at once
which manager has responsibility for managing the incident. That manager
should then consider the following actions, depending on the
circumstances and his or her assessment of the best course of action:

-   Inform the local police and other appropriate authorities
-   Inform all relevant parties of the name and contact details of the
    incident manager. Request that no action be taken in relation to the
    incident without prior agreement with him or her.
-   The incident manager should delegate responsibilities to colleagues
    as appropriate: e.g.:
    -   Contacting Next of Kin. This should be a top priority. Failure
        to do this quickly can damage the relationship of trust with the
        staff member?s family, particularly if they first hear the news
        through the media. This could then make the management of the
        crisis much more difficult.
    -   Answering enquiries from the press
    -   Keeping contact with all relevant staff and other agencies
    -   Providing 24-hour communications and logging all messages and
        events
    -   Marking maps
    -   Ensuring that the crisis management team has sufficient food,
        water and rest

-   Make a plan. Will you negotiate directly with the kidnappers, if
    that is possible? Or will you appoint an intermediary? (A trusted
    intermediary is often thought preferable, to give time for
    decision-makers to consider their responses to any messages from
    the kidnappers.)
-   Decide whether to call in specialist advice, either from the police
    or from a reputable company specialising in hostage negotiations. It
    may help if contact has been made with such a company before any
    kidnap occurs. If you are not sure that you have the necessary
    expertise to handle a kidnapping, specialist advice from a reputable
    company is strongly recommended.
-   Allocate the necessary resources ? human, financial and other ? to
    ensure that your plan has the best possible chance of success

-   Carry out your plan.
-   While you will naturally desire to conclude the incident safely and
    as quickly as possible, kidnap negotiations can sometimes last
    months or even years. Prepare the crisis management team for this,
    while encouraging them to remain optimistic. Keep morale high:
    enough food and rest are helpful, but possibly the greatest aid to
    morale is to manage the incident well, keeping everyone fully
    informed, and taking the best available advice.
-   Ensure strict confidentiality from the onset of the crisis.
    Information should be shared only on a need to know basis. This may
    require the usual management chain to be bypassed, e.g. if someone
    is part of the crisis management team, he or she should be exempted
    from reporting to his or her superior on the crisis.
-   Ransom should not be paid. All humanitarian organisations should
    have a clearly stated policy that ransom will not be paid in case of
    kidnap, since to do so encourages more kidnapping.
-   Throughout the crisis, significant events and decisions should be
    recorded, and lessons learned wherever possible.

-   Attend to the needs of the victim, including making arrangements for
    them to speak to their loved ones and for their physical reunion.
-   Arrange for the authorities to meet and interview the victim.
-   Manage the press; organise a short press conference with the victim
    and/ or their family, and retain control over press contacts.
-   Arrange for a debriefing with the organisation.
-   Arrange time off, with full insurance coverage and no loss
    of income.
-   Arrange for professional and appropriate counseling and long-term
    support mechanisms.
-   Specific preparations need to be made in case of a negative outcome.
-   Once a kidnap incident is resolved, conduct an after-action review,
    to see what lessons can be learned.
