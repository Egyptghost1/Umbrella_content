Traumatic Stress - Causes
=========================

Human rights activists do difficult and challenging work, and see a good
deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times. It
is therefore important to know how to react following a traumatic event,
and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress. (Post-traumatic
stress is dealt with in the Expert Lesson.)

Any event which is very distressing and outside of the realm of normal
human experience can result in traumatic stress. Traumatic stress
usually produces a very intense response, including fear and/or
helplessness, which may overwhelm the individual?s coping mechanisms.
Such a response is a **normal reaction to an abnormal situation.**

Effects
=======

At the time of a traumatic event, the person experiencing the event
might feel numb and unable to respond.

Immediately after a traumatic event, it is common for people to feel
shocked, or dazed, or unable to process their own feelings.

Over several hours or days, the feelings of shock and denial gradually
fade, and other thoughts and feelings take their place.

People react differently and take different amounts of time to come to
terms with a traumatic event. Even so, you may be surprised by the
strength of your feelings. It is normal to experience a mix of feelings.

You may feel:

-   **Frightened** ? that the same thing will happen again, or that you
    might lose control of your feelings and break down.
-   **Helpless** ? that something really bad happened and you could do
    nothing about it.
-   **Angry** ? about what has happened and with whoever
    was responsible.
-   **Guilty** ? that you have survived when others have suffered
    or died.
-   **Sad** ? particularly if people were injured or killed, especially
    someone you knew.
-   **Ashamed or embarrassed** ? that you have these strong feelings you
    can't control, especially if you need others to support you.
-   **Relieved** ? that the danger is over and that the danger has gone.
-   **Hopeful** ? that your life will return to normal. People can start
    to feel more positive about things quite soon after a trauma.

Strong feelings affect your physical health. In the weeks after a
trauma, you may find that you:

-   Cannot sleep
-   Feel very tired
-   Dream a lot and have nightmares
-   Have poor concentration
-   Have memory problems
-   Have difficulty thinking clearly
-   Suffer from headaches
-   Experience changes in appetite
-   Experience changes in sex-drive or libido
-   Have aches and pains
-   Feel that your heart is beating faster.

It may take weeks for some of these feelings and symptoms to pass.
Remember that these are normal reactions to extreme circumstances; they
are not signs that you are weak or sick.

How you can help
================

What can you do straight after a trauma to help someone heal?
Psychological First Aid is an important first step to support a
traumatised person. It is NOT about encouraging or even forcing people
to ?debrief? following a traumatic event. There should be no pressure on
the affected person to recount what happened to them. It helps to
provide a safe and supportive environment for people to feel secure. If
they wish to share their experiences they can, but there is absolutely
no obligation to do so.

-   Ask someone if they require assistance. Remove the person from
    danger and try to keep them safe. If very distressed do not
    leave alone.
-   Ask about people?s needs. Do they need a blanket? Clothes? Medical
    treatment? Work with them to prioritise what they are most in need
    of and what is most important to them at this moment.
-   Listen to people and help them to feel calm.

Coping strategies
=================

Everyone has natural ways of coping. Encourage people to use their own
positive coping strategies, while avoiding negative strategies. This
will help them feel stronger and regain a sense of control. You will
need to adapt the following suggestions to take account of the person?s
culture and what is possible in the particular crisis situation.

**Encourage Positive Coping Strategies:**

-   Get enough rest.
-   Eat as regularly as possible and drink water.
-   Talk and spend time with family and friends.
-   Discuss problems with someone you trust.
-   Do activities that help you relax (walk, sing, pray, play
    with children).
-   Do physical exercise.
-   Find safe ways to help others in the crisis and get involved in
    community activities

.

**Discourage Negative Coping Strategies:**

-   Don?t take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol.
-   Don?t sleep all day.
-   Don?t work all the time without any rest or relaxation.
-   Don?t isolate yourself from friends and loved ones.
-   Don?t neglect basic personal hygiene.
-   Don?t be violent.

It is crucial in the weeks and months after a traumatic event to keep an
eye out for changes in personal attitude (depression, frustration,
etc.), as these may be signs of longer-term Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD). This is dealt with in the Expert lesson.
