Grab bags are bags filled with an individual?s survival essentials in
case they need to move rapidly. They should be prepared for high-risk
activists, journalists and humanitarians at times of heightened risk and
kept close to an exit in their residence ? somewhere easy to grab and
run.

You should plan out several potential escape routes in case of
emergency. Remember that the best escape route may vary depending on the
time of day (e.g. across the roof at night-time, via a garden fence in
the day time) so it is important to move the location of the grab bags
as necessary.

A grab bag might include:

-   Passport/ID ? with multi-entry visas
-   Copies of other key personal and travel documents (e.g.
    driving licence)
-   List of emergency contacts and addresses
-   First aid kit including prescription medicines and medical
    prescriptions
-   Swiss army knife
-   Spare clothes (ensure appropriate for the context)
-   Map/compass (if appropriate to carry maps)
-   Water bottle (with water filter/ water purification tablets)
-   High-energy food (nuts/ snack bars/ chocolate etc.)
-   Mobile phone, charger and pre-paid scratch cards if necessary
-   Torch and batteries
-   Candle
-   Strong string/wire
-   Money (local currency and US dollars; credit cards)
-   Travelling tooth brush/paste and soap
-   Waterproof clothing
-   Insect repellent/Sun-cream
-   Pen and paper
-   Prescription glasses (if needed) and sun glasses
-   Matches
-   Condoms ? can be useful for keeping things dry
-   Phrase book (for foreign language speakers)
-   A head covering
-   Hand-held mirror
-   Radio
-   Satellite phone and charger (if issued)

If involved in an emergency evacuation by air remember that you may be
weight-limited to 15 kilograms or even less. Ensure you prioritise
carefully what you decide to take or you will be forced to leave items
at the airstrip.

See the Evacuation lesson for details on what to do in cases of
hibernation, relocation or evacuation.
