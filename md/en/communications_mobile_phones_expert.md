Get full access to your smartphone
==================================

Firmware is the permanent software that a manufacturer programmes into a
device?s read-only memory. They run in cooperation with the device's
operating system and are responsible for basic operations of the
hardware of your smartphone, such as the speaker, microphone, cameras,
touchscreen, memory, keys, antennas, etc. Most functionalities are
'locked in' so the user is not capable of controlling or altering these
functions. There are however, some applications and functionalities that
can enhance the security of data and communications on a smartphone.
Also there are some other existing functionalities that can be removed
to avoid security risks.

For this, and other reasons, some smartphone users choose to alter the
programs running the smartphone. The process of overcoming these
manufacturer imposed limits on a smartphone is called rooting (in case
of Android devices), or jailbreaking (in case of iOS devices, like
iPhone or iPad). Successful rooting or jailbreaking will enable you to
install additional applications, make modifications, and give you total
control over data storage and memory of the smartphone in order to make
it more secure.

*WARNING:* Rooting or jailbreaking may not be a reversible process, and
it requires experience with software installation and configuration.
Consider the following:

-   There is a risk of making your smartphone permanently inoperable, or
    'bricking' it (i.e. turning it into a 'brick').
-   The manufacturer or mobile carrier warranty may be voided.
-   In some places, this process maybe illegal.

But if you are careful, a rooted device is a straightforward way to gain
more control over your smartphone to make it much more secure.

Rooting or jailbreaking is a complex process and different for every
device. Search the internet for instructions on the best way to root
your own device.

Alternative Firmware
====================

Rooting your phone will allow you to install alternative firmware.\
An example of an alternative firmware for some Android phones
is [Cyanogenmod](http://cyanogenmod.com/) which allows you to uninstall
applications from the system level of your phone. By doing so, you can
reduce the number of ways in which your device can be monitored, such as
data that is sent to your service provider without your knowledge. This
sort of alternative firmware includes features such as the automatic
concealment of your location when online by using a Virtual Private
Network as default, and automatic incognito browsing meaning history of
your communication is not recorded on your smartphone.

Encryption of volumes
=====================

Rooting your phone will also allow you to encrypt its entire data
storage or create a volume on the smartphone to protect certain
information.

Luks Manager allows easy, on-the-fly strong encryption of volumes with a
user-friendly interface. We highly recommend that you install this tool
before you start storing important data on your Android device and use
the Encrypted Volumes that the [Luks
Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nemesis2.luksmanager&hl=en)
provides to store all your data.

Data encryption tools
=====================

The Android Privacy Guard (APG) allows OpenGPG encryption for files and
emails. It can be used to keep your files and documents safe on your
phone, as well when emailing.\
You can learn how to install and use it in the [APG
Guide](umbrella://lesson/k9-&-apg) in the tool kit.

[Cryptonite](https://code.google.com/p/cryptonite/) is another open
source files encryption tool with more advanced features on it, and
specially prepared for rooted Android phones with a custom firmware.
