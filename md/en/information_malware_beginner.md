What is malware?
================

Malware, short for "malicious software," is software that is used to
harm computer users. It can do things like gather information,
impersonate a user, gain access to other computers, or stop a computer
from working. It could do this by allowing an attacker to record from a
webcam and microphone, disabling anti-virus programs, recording
keystrokes, copying emails and other documents, stealing passwords, and
more. Most malware is criminal and is often used to obtain banking
information or other valuable information. However, it is also used by
governments, law enforcement agencies, and even private citizens to spy
on users.

Anti-virus software
===================

You should always use anti-virus software on your computer and your
smartphone, which are easily available to buy and download.
[Avast](https://www.avast.com) is an easy to use anti-virus program for
Windows. [Clam Win](http://www.clamwin.com/) is a good open source
alternative. Anti-virus software can be quite effective at combatting
cheap, ?non targeted? malware that might be used by criminals against
hundreds of targets. However such software is usually ineffective
against targeted attacks, such as ones carried out by governments
against.

How can I tell if my computer is compromised?
---------------------------------------------

Malware is very difficult to detect. Scanners such as
[Spybot](https://www.safer-networking.org/) or
[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/) can detect and protect
against some malware threats and are useful to use.\
While most malware avoids detection by software, it is still sometimes
possible to find indicators of it on your computer. For example,
services will sometimes send you a warning email if they believe your
account has been targeted, you may notice a light indicating that your
webcam is turned on when you have not activated it yourself, or your
settings have been altered to send copies of your emails to an
unfamiliar email address.

How can attackers use malware to target me?
===========================================

The most common method of attack is to trick you into installing the
malware yourself. There are many ways they try to do this.\

-   They may disguise the malware as a link to a website, a document, a
    software update, or even a program designed to help secure
    your computer.
-   You may be targeted via email (which may look as if it?s coming from
    someone you know), via a message on Skype or Twitter, or even via a
    link posted to your Facebook page.
-   You can also infect your computer by connecting infected hardware,
    like a USB key given to you or found near your office, or a phone
    connected to charge.

The more targeted the attack the more they?ll try to make it look like
something you want to open. For example, in Syria, pro-Assad hackers
targeted members of the opposition with malware hidden in fake
revolutionary documents and a fake anti-hacking tool. And in Morocco,
activists were targeted with malware hidden in a document made to look
as if it had been sent by an Al-Jazeera reporter, promising information
about a political scandal.

There is also the possibility of someone gaining physical access to your
computer to install malware themselves. You can read more about
preventing against such attacks in the [Organisational Security ? Office
section](umbrella://lesson/office).

How can I avoid getting infected?
=================================

-   Always make sure you are running the latest version of your software
    and downloading the latest security patches. Only the latest updates
    have the latest protections. It is a common belief that if you are
    running an unregistered copy of Windows, you cannot or should not
    accept security updates. This is not true. Always update. [Secunia
    PSI](https://secunia.com/products/consumer/psi/sys_req/) for Windows
    is a free tool that will check to make sure your software is up
    to date.
-   Only download software from official sites.
-   Only download software from official sites.
-   Avoid open opening suspicious attachments (anything from someone you
    don?t know) or clicking on suspicious links (any links you
    didn?t request)
-   If you are using Gmail, open unusual attachments in Google Drive
    rather than downloading them.
-   Double check the sender?s email address if you get an email with an
    attachment or link you weren?t expecting, even if the email appears
    to be written by a friend or colleague. If something seems odd or
    their tone is unusual, it doesn?t hurt to email the friend to check
    they sent it and mention it to colleagues.
-   Stay alert when browsing websites. Watch for browser windows that
    appear automatically, and read them carefully. When in doubt, you
    should close 'pop up windows' by clicking the X in the upper corner,
    rather than by clicking Cancel.
-   Disconnect your computer from the Internet when you are not using it
    and shut it down completely overnight

What should I do if I find malware on my computer?
==================================================

-   The first thing you should do if you find malware on your
    computer is unplug your computer from the Internet and stop using it
    immediately. Every keystroke you make may be being sent to
    an attacker.
-   Log into a computer you believe is safe and change your
    passwords; every password that you typed on your computer while it
    was infected should now be considered to be compromised.
-   You may wish to reinstall the operating system (eg Windows,
    Android, IOS) on your computer in order to remove the malware. This
    will remove most malware, but some especially sophisticated malware
    may persist.
-   If you can, take your computer to a security expert, who may be able
    to discover more details about the malware.
-   If you have some idea of when your computer was infected, you may
    reinstall files from before that date. Reinstalling files from after
    the date of infection may re-infect your computer.
