The best defence against kidnapping is having and practising a
high-quality, well-managed security management plan, which is based on a
thorough understanding of the general context and risks, and on the
context and threat of kidnapping specific to your location.
Understanding who carries out kidnappings, and why, will help shape your
avoidance and survival strategies.

The main reasons for kidnappings are:

-   To hold for ransom
-   To cause a political effect
-   To achieve publicity
-   To be used as human shields

The main actors that carry out kidnappings are:

-   Criminals
-   Political extremists
-   Terrorists
-   Militia groups
-   Regimes that use terror

Factors which may encourage kidnapping:

-   The state?s ability to provide protection from the crime, and
    prosecute those who engage in such activity
-   A lack of political, legal or military response will encourage more
    actors to become involved
-   Media coverage of successful kidnap attempts
-   High financial rewards from kidnapping

2.  Capture
3.  Transport (This could happen several times)
4.  Confinement
5.  Release/ Termination

This Beginner lesson concentrates on the first 2 phases: how to AVOID
kidnap by reducing the incentives and opportunities for kidnap and
making it more complex for prospective kidnappers.

For advice on survival techniques in the event of being kidnapped go to
the Advanced lesson, and for advice on what to do if a colleague has
been kidnapped go to the Expert lesson.

-   **Stay low profile**\
    Don?t use big expensive cars; avoid ?no-go? areas in town; don?t
    display assets etc.
-   **Build key relationships**\
    Build relationships with key actors who may be of use in the
    prevention of kidnapping. In environments where a host is
    responsible for the wellbeing of their guests, it might be a good
    idea to obtain local protection. Likewise, asking respected elders
    to join a site visit may offer a form of protection. Only good
    knowledge of the context will determine whether this tactic will
    reduce the risk.
-   **Be aware of how work is received**\
    If the political or conflict situation is putting your work at a
    heightened risk be prepared to suspend the programme if necessary
    and leave the country for a period of time if appropriate. (See
    Evacuation lesson for more advice on this)
-   **Have a public policy of no ransom**

-   **Be cautious**\
    Don?t make yourself an easy target. This will mean different things
    depending on the local context but may include avoiding walking to
    the shops on foot or driving alone at night. See the Vehicle lesson
    for detailed security advice for vehicles. At times of heightened
    risk you should restrict movements to minimum necessary.
-   **Avoid predictability**\
    50% of abductions take place while the victim is in their car. The
    majority take place in the early morning, within 400 meters of home
    or office, due to a predictable pattern of behaviour. Roadblocks or
    car accidents may be staged to create a scene where abductors then
    have a pretext to operate quickly, disguised as officials. Avoid
    predictability when moving between residences and offices, as well
    as in off-hours activities, such as taking children to school and
    going shopping. It may be difficult but try to vary travel times
    and routes.
-   **Reduce visibility**\
    This might mean staff travelling in a trusted taxi rather than an
    easily identifiable agency vehicle. If there is a suspicion that
    radio communications may be overheard, staff should not be
    identified when travelling. Information about movement plans, routes
    and travel times should be encoded.
-   **Ensure good site security for homes and offices**\
    Site protection and strict rules governing the identification of
    strangers and limits on access complicates the situation for
    potential kidnappers.

In simple terms this means ?watch to see if someone is watching you?. A
successful kidnapping normally needs planning, and the perpetrators will
be watching the residence, office and movements of their identified
target for some time before making their move. They may try to find out
more about the residence by presenting themselves as servicemen, or
checking the locks of doors and windows while staff are away. They may
follow a target in a car to establish routines and identify the ideal
point at which to strike. Practicing counter-surveillance may also make
you aware of an imminent attack.

-   Be observant and watch for anything unusual
-   Note if someone starts asking numerous unexpected questions or takes
    an unexpected interest in you are or the work that you do.
-   Situational awareness is vital
-   Know the ?choke points? on your route
-   Multiple sightingsÂ of the same person, vehicle, or activity may
    confirm you?re being watched.
-   If you are suspicious that you are being followed you can speed up,
    slow down, make three right turns, stall at a green light and
    continue just as the lights change back to red, take a one way
    street, or make a dead stop. Check if any cars following are doing
    the same thing.

Practicing counter-surveillance effectively requires constant attention
and knowledge about the local environment, including who belongs in the
locality and who does not. See the Counter-surveillance lesson for more
detailed advice.
