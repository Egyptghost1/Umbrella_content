Keeping your webmail private ? HTTPS
====================================

There are a few important steps that you can take in order to increase
the security of your email communication. The first is to make sure that
only the person to whom you send a given message is able to read it.

Keeping your webmail private ? HTTPS
------------------------------------

HTTPS, (also referred to as SSL or TLS), encrypts your communications so
that it cannot be read by other people on your network. This can include
the other people using the same Wi-Fi in an airport or at a café, the
other people at your office or school, the administrators at your ISP,
malicious hackers, governments, or law enforcement officials.
Communications sent over your web browser, including the web pages that
you visit and the content of your emails, using HTTP rather than HTTPS
are very easy for an attacker to intercept and read.

Most email providers give you a way of accessing your email using a web
browser, such as Firefox or Chrome. Of these providers, most of them
provide support for HTTPS. You should always make sure that your
connection is secure before logging in, reading your email, or sending a
message. You can tell that your email provider supports HTTPS if you log
in to your webmail and the URL at the top of your browser begins with
the letters HTTPS instead of HTTP (for
example: https://mail.google.com).

If your email provider supports HTTPS, but does not do so by default,
try replacing HTTP with HTTPS in the URL and refresh the page. If you?d
like to make sure that you are always using HTTPS on sites where it is
available, download the [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) browser add-on for
Firefox or Chrome.

Webmail providers that use HTTPS by default include Gmail, RiseUp and
Yahoo.

Some webmail providers give you the option of choosing to use HTTPS by
default by selecting it in your settings, such as Hotmail.

HTTPS is the most basic level of encryption for your web browsing that
we recommend for everybody. It is as basic as putting on your seat belt
when you drive.

Switching to a more secure email account
========================================

While using HTTPS protects your communications from other people on your
network, there are some things that it does not do. When you send email
using HTTPS, your email provider still gets an unencrypted copy of your
communication. Governments and law enforcement may be able to access
this data with a warrant.

Yahoo and Hotmail, for instance, provide a secure connection only while
you log in, to protect your password, but your messages themselves are
sent and received insecurely. They also insert the IP address of the
computer you are using into all of the messages you send. We do not
recommend that you use them for secure communications.

Gmail
-----

Gmail accounts, on the other hand, use a secure connection during log-in
and all the way until you log out and, unlike Yahoo or Hotmail, Gmail
avoids revealing your IP address to email recipients. One way to make
Gmail (or Yahoo) even more secure is to turn on 2-step-verification.
This is one of the safest and simplest computer-security measures. To
break into an account with 2-Step Verification, intruders would not only
have to know your username and password, they'd also have to get a hold
of your phone, or codes you hold with you. Setting it up is simple: [see
here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en).

However, it is not recommend that you rely on Google for the total
confidentiality of your sensitive email communication. Google scans and
records the content of its users' messages for a wide variety of
purposes and has, in the past, conceded to the demands of governments
that restrict digital freedom.

RiseUp
------

If possible, you should create a new RiseUp email account by visiting
<https://mail.riseup.net>. RiseUp offers free email to activists around
the world and takes great care to protect the information stored on
their servers. Unlike Google, they have very strict policies regarding
their users' privacy and no commercial interests that might some day
conflict with those policies. In order to create a new RiseUp account,
however, you may need two 'invite codes.' These codes can be given out
by anyone who already has a RiseUp account. Otherwise, you will need to
tell RiseUp about yourself and they may give you access.

Recipient security
==================

Regardless of what secure email tools you decide to use, keep in mind
that every message has a sender and one or more recipients. You yourself
are only part of the picture.

-   Even if you access your email account securely, consider what
    precautions your contacts may or may not take when sending, reading
    and replying to messages.
-   Try to learn where your contacts' email providers are located,
    as well. Naturally, some countries are more aggressive than others
    when it comes to email surveillance. To ensure private
    communication, you and your contacts should all use secure email
    services hosted in relatively safe countries.
-   And, if you want to be certain that messages are not intercepted
    between your email server and a contact's email server, you might
    all choose to use accounts from the same provider. RiseUp is one
    good choice.

Tips on improving your email security
=====================================

-   Always be careful when opening email attachments that you are not
    expecting, that come from someone you do not know or that contain
    suspicious subject lines. When opening emails like this, you should
    ensure that your anti-virus software is up-to-date and pay close
    attention to any warnings displayed by your browser or
    email program. See more about this in the
    [Malware](umbrella://lesson/malware) lesson.
-   Using anonymity software like Tor, which is described in the
    [Internet](umbrella://lesson/the-internet) lesson, can help you hide
    your chosen email service from anyone who might be monitoring your
    Internet connection.
-   When creating an account that you intend to use while remaining
    anonymous from your own email recipients, or from public forums to
    which you might post messages by email, you must be careful to avoid
    using Hotmail, Yahoo, or any other webmail provider that includes
    your IP address in the messages you send.
-   You may consider using several different, anonymous email accounts
    for communicating with different groups of people to protect of your
    contact network. You may also use different email accounts for
    signing up to Internet services which require email accounts.
-   After all above precautions it is still very important to beware of
    what you write in the messages and what impact would it have if it
    fell into the wrong hands. One way of increasing the security of
    information exchange is to develop a code system for sensitive
    information exchange, so you would not use real names of the people,
    real addresses of places, etc.
-   Remember that secure email will not do you any good if everything
    you type is recorded by spyware and periodically sent over the
    Internet to a third party. The [Malware](umbrella://lesson/malware)
    lesson and offers some advice on how to prevent this sort of thing,
    and the [Passwords](umbrella://lesson/passwords) lesson will help
    you protect your accounts.

Email on Smartphones
====================

In the first instance, consider if you really need to use your
smartphone to access your email. Securing a computer and its content is
generally simpler than doing so for a mobile device such as a
smartphone. A smartphone is more susceptible to theft, monitoring and
intrusion.

-   If it is absolutely vital that you access your email on your
    smartphone, there are actions you can take to minimize the risks.
-   Do not rely on smartphone as your primary means for accessing
    your email. Downloading (and removing) emails from an email server
    and storing them only on your smartphone is not advised. You can set
    up your email application to use only copies of emails.
-   If you use email encryption with some of your contacts, consider
    installing it on your smartphone, too. The additional benefit is
    that encrypted emails will remain secret if the phone falls into
    wrong hands. See the Advanced section of this lesson for details on
    how to do so.

Signs your email has been hacked
================================

Signs
-----

If you suspect your email account has been hacked or compromised, you
can take steps to reduce the damage done. While it is difficult to be
certain, there may be clues such as:

-   You notice any changes to your email account content or settings
    that you didn't make;
-   Your email contacts notify you that they have received an email that
    you didn't send;
-   -   You are regularly not receiving some email messages from your
    colleagues that they insist that they sent to you;
-   Some private information that was sent or received exclusively by
    email was made known to a third party, though neither you nor your
    correspondent shared it with anyone else;
-   If on your account activity log (if your email provider offers one)
    you see that your account was accessed at time that you do not
    remember or from a place (or IP address) that you did not go to.

What to do if your email is hacked
==================================

In such situations you may want to take some cautionary action:

-   **Stop using this email account for sensitive information
    exchange**, at least until you understand the situation better.
-   **Change your password** for this and all other accounts with a
    similar password as soon as possible.
-   **Change your security question answers** (if you use them) for all
    accounts, so they are impossible to guess, or find the answer
    through researching information about you.
-   **If you are not able to log in** to your account to change the
    passwords, consider getting in contact with your email provider to
    try to reclaim your account.
-   **Mitigate information loss and impact** to your community.
    Determine what kinds of sensitive information and contacts you had
    in your account and decide whom you should alert. Determine what
    services (web, financial, etc.) you need to revisit or cancel. It is
    important that you **check the folders of your account** to research
    on what could have been sent from your account and to
    act accordingly.
-   **Review your account settings** to see possible changes that has
    been made. Check accounts signature option for links and malware,
    forwarding options that would allow to copy emails that you receive
    to third account, away message, display name, etc.
-   **Research how your account was compromised.** Was it because of
    having a weak password, or due to malware infection, etc. The more
    you will establish about this, the better you will be able to
    respond to the situation and better you will be able to protect
    your contacts.
-   **Review security of all of your devices** that access emails from
    this account, and devices on which you stored the password to this
    email account. Scan your computer: learn how in the
    [Malware](umbrella://lesson/malware) lesson. Consider switching to
    more secure programs like Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice and
    other Free and Open Source Programs. After making the above
    improvements to the security of your devices, change your account
    passwords again to new, stronger ones.
-   **Consider reporting hacking** of your account to your
    email provider.
-   **Consider using a more secure account**, e.g. one that notifies you
    of and prevent access from unusual places or devices. Consider using
    account that is hosted outside of your country. Consider using email
    encryption, such as PGP, outlines in the Advanced section of
    this lesson.
-   **Consider avoiding storing read emails.**

It is important that you act quickly and precisely in the situation like
this. Having a prepared and rehearsed plan may help you.
