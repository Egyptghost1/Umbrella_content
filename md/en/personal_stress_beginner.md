Types of Stress
===============

Stress is a natural reaction, and it can be positive and stimulating.
Not all stress is bad. There are different types of stress, both healthy
and unhealthy. Healthy stress helps people focus on the task at hand,
mobilises energy and prepares them for action. When stress occurs too
often, however, or is too intense or lasts too long, it turns from
positive to negative.

There are 3 different types of unhealthy stress: chronic, traumatic, and
also post-traumatic.\
\
1. Chronic stress is a combination of stress factors that builds up over
time, eroding our resilience and ability to work or function
effectively. This type of stress is dealt with below in the beginner?s
lesson.\
\
Traumatic stress results from directly experiencing, or being otherwise
closely exposed to, traumatic events or incidents that are life-
threatening or involve physical and emotional loss. It is dealt with in
the Advanced lesson\
\
Post-traumatic stress is prolonged stress which can occur months or even
years after an event. It is dealt with in the Expert lesson.\
\
People who have been trained about stress responses often react better
under stress because they understand what is happening to them.

Each person will experience stress differently and therefore must manage
their stress in their own way. Stress management varies by culture,
gender, personality, identity and many other factors.

Chronic Stress - Causes
=======================

Chronic (or cumulative) stress occurs regularly among aid workers and
activists, yet often goes unrecognised or unreported.

With healthy levels of stress, symptoms are generally mild and temporary
? people return to normal functioning when the stress factor is removed.
If exposure to stress is excessive or long-term however, symptoms can
persist and multiply, resulting in chronic or cumulative stress. Not
only is this worse for the body physically and mentally, but chronic
stress can also erode coping mechanisms.

Chronic stress builds slowly and may be hard to notice in yourself or
others. If not properly managed, chronic stress can lead to burnout.

Effects

people differ in terms of the symptoms they exhibit.

Engaging in some of these types of behaviours are security risks in and

and your organisation that it is dealt with properly.

Dealing with it - For Individuals
=================================

Stress management is an individual process. There is no one best set of
techniques. For stress management to be effective, it must be consistent
and comprise the techniques that work best for each person.

It is important to recognise that it is impossible to take care of
others if you do not take care of yourself.

-   **Learn about stress.** Be aware of the signs and symptoms
    of stress.
-   **Know yourself.** Learn to observe your feelings and attitudes
    before trying to control your behavior.
-   **Eat well and exercise.** Establish a regular exercise program and
    stick to it. Beneficial exercise for stress reduction includes deep
    breathing and muscle relaxation exercises. Keep a healthy diet and
    eat regularly.
-   ?**Get rest and relaxation.** Get adequate, regular sleep. Maintain
    your normal routines for relaxation, such as hobbies, reading, etc.
-   **Practice belief systems.** Maintain spiritual health consistent
    with your personal beliefs.
-   **Maintain a sense of humour and perspective.** Try to have contact
    with others outside of the work environment.
-   **Be informed.** Knowledge of the work situation and environment
    provides an effective way of checking rumors and immediately
    addressing concerns.
-   ?**Talk to people.** Sharing a problem with others may help you find
    a solution and will make you feel less isolated. If unable to talk
    to others about your feelings, keep a journal or diary or
    write letters.
-   **Change a stressful environment as much as possible.** Refuse to
    see yourself as a helpless victim of circumstance. When faced with a
    difficult situation, identify the problem, think of alternatives,
    evaluate the alternatives, and finally select and implement the
    best alternative.
-   **Think positive!**

Dealing with it - For Managers
==============================

In volatile environments, expectations of managers can often be
unrealistic ? both in terms of the volume of tasks and the level of
skill with which they need to be performed. The level of responsibility
can be a significant source of stress, especially when it does not stop
at night, or on weekends or holidays. All staff need to feel that their
managers are strong, solid and reliable and a source of stability. A
manager who shows signs of severe stress, or who continues in post
although burned out, is likely to demoralise his or her staff. The
following tactics can help managers to cope with their own stress and
reduce that of their staff.

![](stress2.png)

-   **Acknowledge your own limitations, to yourself and to your staff.**
    Admitting that you too are not immune to stress does not need to
    undermine your authority if you are managing according to principles
    and arguments that are defendable.
-   **Develop a good relationship with your own manager.** Ask them to
    come and experience at close hand the realities you are facing, and
    ask them to protect you from unnecessary pressures from HQ.
-   **Delegate.** Share tasks with your staff or try to create a senior
    management team around you that shares responsibility, although you
    remain the ultimate decision-maker. Insist on appointing a
    high-quality person when the post needs to be filled.
-   **The ?buddy system?.** Find a sounding board or possibly a buddy in
    one of your peers from another agency. Staff members may agree in
    advance to monitor each other?s reactions to identify signs of
    excessive stress and fatigue levels.
-   **Recognition of individual staff efforts.** Express appreciation on
    a regular basis. People do better in difficult situations when they
    feel that other people care about them. Provide constructive
    feedback to build self-confidence when addressing problem areas.
-   **Regular time off for all staff.** During periods of heavy
    workloads or in times of crisis, it is common for staff to attempt
    to work all day, every day. This can quickly lead to burnout. Many
    staff members need to be given permission to take care
    of themselves. Providing an afternoon off to a staff member who is
    obviously stressed ? and therefore often ineffective - can improve
    productivity in the long term. In emergency response situations,
    regular rotation of staff out of the hostile area every three to
    four weeks can help prevent build-up of excess stress.
-   **Provide a good example.** Demonstrate proper stress management by
    eating properly, resting and taking appropriate time off.
