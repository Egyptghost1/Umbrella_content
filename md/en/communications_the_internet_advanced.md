Anonymity Online
================

Accessing information on the Internet, or publishing material online
such as photos or videos, leaves many traces of who and where you are
and what you are doing. This may put you at risk. You can reduce your
risks through the use of anonymising tools such as Tor.

**Remember, these tools can only protect your anonymity if you do not
log in to sites or post something online that could identify you!**

Tor
===

Tor is free and open-source software that provides anonymity as well as
allowing you to circumvent censorship. When you use Tor, the information
you transmit is safer because your traffic is bounced around a
distributed network of servers. This can provide anonymity, since the
computer with which you?re communicating will never see yourÂ IP address,
but instead will see the IP address of the last Tor router through which
your traffic travelled.

One of Tor's strengths is that it does not just work with a browser but
can be used with various types of Internet software. Email programs,
including Mozilla Thunderbird, and instant messaging programs, including
Pidgin, can operate through Tor, either to access filtered services or
to hide your use of those services.

Tor is the gold standard for secure censorship circumvention. It can be
slow and tricky to use. However, it also provides a reliable, secure and
public means of circumvention that saves you from having to worry about
whether or not you trust the individuals who operate your proxies and
the websites you visit. Tor is open source and can be downloaded free
online for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.

To learn how to install and use Tor, see the [Tor tool
guide](umbrella://lesson/tor-for-windows).

Anonymity online on your mobile
===============================

Orbot and Orweb
---------------

Orbot is a free proxy app that enables other apps to use the internet
more securely. It uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then
hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world.
This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and
identity protection available is worth the wait.\
To learn how to install and use Orbot, see the [Orbot tool
guide](umbrella://lesson/orbot-&-orweb).

Orweb is the safest browser on Android. Orbot and Orweb together
circumvent web filters and firewalls, and offer a truly private internet
connection. Both apps are available for Android and iPhone.To learn how
to install and use Orweb, see the [Orweb tool
guide](umbrella://lesson/orbot-&-orweb).

**Remember, these tools can only protect your anonymity if you do not
log in to sites or post something online that could identify you!**
