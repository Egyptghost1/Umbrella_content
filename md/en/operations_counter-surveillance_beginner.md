Surveillance
============

Surveillance is the monitoring of people?s behaviour, activities, or
other patterns for the purpose of harming, influencing, managing,
directing, or protecting them.

**Why might people be interested in keeping you under physical
surveillance?**

-   Break-in/ theft of sensitive materials
-   Arrest
-   Monitor who is coming and going from the office
-   Intimidation
-   Physical attack on staff

**Who might be interested in keeping you under surveillance?**

-   Authorities of the country in which the regional office is located
    (police, intelligence, military)
-   External security agencies of other countries in the region
-   Criminals
-   Terrorists
-   Private contractors
-   Embassy officials of ?friendly? countries
-   Individuals (may be disgruntled with the organisation)

What techniques are available to carry out surveillance?
========================================================

-   Digital surveillance (monitoring of digital communications, mobile
    phones etc.)
-   Human surveillance (on foot, in a vehicle)
-   Technical surveillance (bugs, listening devices, video cameras,
    number plate readers etc.)

These lessons deal with how to counter human surveillance. For advice on
digital surveillance see the Information and Communications lessons. For
advice on how technical surveillance see the Meetings lesson and
Home/Office section.

How to Identify if Your Office is Under Surveillance
----------------------------------------------------

Surveillance generally requires that the adversary is able to observe
the activities of its targets. This means there are a limited number of
physical sites they can use for surveillance. The best thing to do when
looking for surveillance is to try to think like an adversary ? what
might you do is you were trying to monitor your office? From where might
you carry out such surveillance?

-   **Take a baseline**\
    It is important to gain an understanding of what ?normal? conditions
    look like. (For example, where cars normally park or people
    normally stand).
-   **Identify and record**\
    From this, try to identify and record any unusual activities. (For
    example, people in locations where they shouldn?t be or
    aren?t normally).
-   **Filter out coincidence**\
    Filter out the chances that something could be a coincidence by
    concentrating on unusual activities and applying common sense
    filters (e.g. if someone is standing in a place where people don?t
    normally stand pay more attention to them. Do they look like they
    are from the area? Are they paying an unusual amount of attention to
    your activities?) Look for 3 signs that something is out of the
    ordinary or 3 repeat sightings.
-   **Notify others**\
    It is important to notify others of any suspicions and to keep a log
    of them. This allows the monitoring of patterns which otherwise
    might not emerge. For example, if you notice someone suspicious and
    then a colleague notices something else suspicious on a separate
    occasion but this information is not shared, then a valuable
    opportunity to confirm a security threat is missed.
-   **Trust your senses**\
    Trust your senses ? there may be clues of a potential arrest or
    violent attack. Often, HRDs report that there were warning signs
    prior to an attack, but they chose to ignore the warning signs or
    dismissed it as paranoia.

What To Do If Your Office Is Under Surveillance
===============================================

-   **Consider the risks**\
    Confrontation with suspicious people should be done with caution,
    before doing so, consider the risks. For example, what might that
    person be doing? What is the past history of threats against your
    organisation or yourself? Is it likely that they will attack you
    immediately if you confront them or is it more likely that they will
    just leave and send someone else? If you confront someone they are
    likely to be replaced by another (unknown) agent, and you then lose
    the benefit of being able to monitor the surveillance being carried
    out against you.
-   **Increase protection**\
    Increase your office protection by reducing the ability of an
    adversary to conduct surveillance. For example by putting up
    screening near your building, using CCTV and/or guards, closing
    blinds, locking gates, selecting sites which are not easily
    overlooked, strict access controls to your building etc.
-   **Continue monitoring**\
    Continue to monitor the general security environment and increase
    your observation of threats during periods of higher tension ? e.g.
    protests, elections, sensitive national holidays etc.
