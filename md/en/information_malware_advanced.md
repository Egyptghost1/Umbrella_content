Tips on using anti-virus software effectively
=============================================

The beginner section gave a run through of useful anti-virus software
such as [Avast](https://www.avast.com) or [Clam
Win](http://www.clamwin.com/) and anti-malware software such as
[Spybot](https://www.safer-networking.org/) or
[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/). There are a few ways in
which you can make sure you get the most out of your software.

-   Do not run two anti-virus programs at the same time, as this might
    cause your computer to run extremely slowly or to crash. Uninstall
    one before installing another. However anti-malware software is
    designed to work alongside anti-virus software.
-   Make sure that your anti-virus program updates itself regularly.
    Without updates it can quickly become ineffective. All of the
    software recommended here supports free updating.
-   Enable your anti-virus software's 'always on' virus-detection
    feature if it has one. It may also be called 'Realtime Protection,'
    'Resident Protection,' or something similar.
-   Scan all of the files on your computer regularly. You don't have to
    do this every day but you should do it from time to time. How often
    may depend on the circumstances. Have you connected your computer to
    unknown networks recently? With whom have you been sharing USB
    memory sticks? Do you frequently receive strange attachments by
    email? Has someone else in your home or office recently had virus
    problems? Tools such as Avast can do this for you.

Preventing virus or spyware infection
=====================================

-   If you need to open a file from someone you don?t know well, you
    should save the attachment to a folder on your computer, then open
    the appropriate application (such as Microsoft Word or
    Adobe Acrobat) yourself. If you use the program's File menu to open
    the attachment manually, rather than double-clicking the file or
    allowing your email program to open it automatically, you are less
    likely to contract a virus.
-   Hover over URLs and hyperlinks to check where they lead. If you're
    unsure about a URL, check it
    at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/#url).
-   Before inserting removable media, such as CDs or USB sticks, into
    your computer, you should disable your operating system's
    'AutoPlay' feature. (This is usually found under the Properties
    section of My Computer)
-   Improve the security of your Web browser by preventing it from
    automatically running the potentially dangerous programs that are
    sometimes contained within webpages you visit. If you are using
    Mozilla Firefox, you can install the NoScript add-on.
-   Download over an encrypted connection (usually SSL in the browser)
    whenever possible.
-   Using free and open-source software significantly lowers your risk
    of being infected by malware. These tools are often written and
    updated for free by volunteers and are generally more secure than
    their proprietary alternatives. In particular, you should consider
    replacing Internet Explorer, Outlook and Microsoft Office with
    Firefox, Thunderbird and LibreOffice, respectively. You should also
    consider switching from the Microsoft Windows operating system to a
    more secure open-source alternative like Ubuntu or ChromeOS.

Preventing untrusted network connections
========================================

-   A firewall helps to protect your computer from unauthorised
    connections to and from the Internet. It can also help reduce the
    spread of malware if you are infected. Most operating systems have
    firewalls included but check to make sure they are turned on. (You
    can usually find this under Control Panel &gt; Security) There are
    also excellent free programs such as
    [Comodo](https://securityinabox.org/comodofirewall_main) Personal
    Firewall, which can help keep your computer secure.
-   Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a
    firewall installed. Read more about this in the Network Section.
-   Only install essential programs on the computer you use for
    sensitive work, and make sure you get them from a reputable source.
    Uninstall any software that you do not use.
